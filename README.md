It’s a 5-day online course on March 31 - April 4 designed to help developers dive deep into the basics of the technologies and techniques behind Generative AI (Gen AI). Created by a team of Google’s ML researchers and engineers, this program includes both conceptual in-depth analyses and hands-on coding examples so you can tackle new Gen AI projects with confidence.

How does the intensive work?

📚 Daily Assignments: This includes the latest white papers, a companion podcast (generated by NotebookLM), and companion codelabs in AI Studio. 

🎥 Daily Livestream Seminars and AMAs: Live everyday on [Kaggle's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqFaTIg4myu-lbBTrUpoQQIzZZxvrOaP5), where the authors and course contributors will dive deeper into the topics and answer your burning questions. Plus, we've got fun surprises in store to keep the learning engaging.

🆕 Capstone project: Level up your skills and build your portfolio with a real-world capstone project. Complete at least one code lab during the 5 day course and the capstone project at the end to compete for prizes like Kaggle certificates, badges, swags and the recognition of being celebrated on Kaggle and Google’s social media channel. If you’re planning to come to Google Cloud Next, you get to connect with the Google experts in person at the kiosks and lightning talks. Learn more about the capstone project during the course.
