 💡 What You’ll Learn
 ---

Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process. You'll also learn more about advanced agentic architectures and approaches such as multi-agent systems, agent evaluation and more.

The codelabs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot (including an example using Gemini 2.0’s [Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live)), and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a café.

Happy Learning!
