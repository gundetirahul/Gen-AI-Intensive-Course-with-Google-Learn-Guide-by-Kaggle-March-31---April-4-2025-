---

Hello again, Learner!

**Complete Unit 4 - ‚ÄúDomain-Specific LLMs‚Äù**

- Listen to the [summary podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWqspvVvNzA&list=PLqFaTIg4myu_yKJpvF8WE2JfaG5kGuvoE&index=7) for this unit.
- To complement the podcast, read the [‚ÄúSolving Domain-Specific Problems Using LLMs‚Äù](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17oA0s8yh8xNZ5ZKiM7cR3lPFlRO-P02a/view) whitepaper.

- Complete these codelabs on Kaggle:
   - [Tune](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-fine-tuning-a-custom-model) a Gemini model for a custom task
   - [Use](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-google-search-grounding) Google Search data in generation

üí° What You‚Äôll Learn
---

In today‚Äôs reading, you‚Äôll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

In the codelabs, you'll learn how to add real-world data to a model using Google Search and then visualize it with plotting tools via the Live API. You will also learn how to fine-tune a custom Gemini model using your own labeled data to solve custom tasks.


Happy Learning!
