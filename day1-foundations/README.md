## **ü´° welcome to Day 1 (Foundational Large Language Models & Prompt Engineering)**

Today you‚Äôll explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. You‚Äôll also get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

The code lab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini API and cover several prompt techniques and how different parameters impact the prompts.
